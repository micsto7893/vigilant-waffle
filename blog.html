          <h3>The Vigilant Classic: A Waffle You Can Trust</h3>

          <p>
            Before experimenting, before adding chaos, and before questioning your life
            choices at a waffle iron, there must be a foundation. This is that foundation.
            The Vigilant Classic is a dependable waffle—calm, structured, and unlikely to
            surprise you in ways that require reflection.
          </p>

          <p>
            This recipe exists not to impress, but to <em>work</em>. It is the waffle you
            make when clarity is needed, expectations are reasonable, and breakfast should
            not become an experiment.
          </p>

          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1¾ cups milk</li>
            <li>½ cup melted butter (cooled, but not suspicious)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Preheat your waffle iron. This step matters more than it seems.
              The waffle notices when you rush.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder,
              and salt until they appear cooperative.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk, melted butter,
              and vanilla. Stir calmly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.
              Some small lumps are acceptable and should not be interrogated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lightly grease the waffle iron if required. Pour batter according to your
              waffle iron’s instructions. Close the lid and wait.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cook until golden brown and crisp. Remove carefully and repeat until
              the batter—or your patience—is gone.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Serving Notes</h3>
          <p>
            Serve immediately with butter, syrup, or quiet satisfaction. This waffle pairs
            well with coffee, reflection, and the feeling that at least one thing today
            went according to plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Final observation:</strong> A good waffle does not demand attention.
            It simply exists, performs its role, and supports whatever chaos comes next.
            This waffle is vigilant, dependable, and deeply uninterested in being summoned.

          <h3>The Chaos Waffle: A Bold Experiment in Breakfast</h3>

          <p>
            Once a stable waffle exists, chaos becomes inevitable. This recipe is what
            happens when curiosity outweighs caution and the waffle iron becomes a
            laboratory. The Chaos Waffle is not reckless—but it is adventurous.
          </p>

          <p>
            This waffle is for mornings when rules feel optional, measurements feel
            flexible, and breakfast needs to make a statement. Surprisingly, it still
            works. The waffle remains vigilant.
          </p>

          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar (because depth matters)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon nutmeg (optional, but encouraged)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1¾ cups milk (or buttermilk, if chaos leans traditional)</li>
            <li>½ cup melted butter or neutral oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>
              ½ cup mix-ins (choose one or combine carefully):
              <ul>
                <li>Chocolate chips</li>
                <li>Chopped walnuts or pecans</li>
                <li>Blueberries</li>
                <li>Crushed pretzels (yes, really)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat the waffle iron and mentally prepare for unexpected success.</li>
            <li>
              In a large bowl, whisk together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt,
              cinnamon, and nutmeg. The aroma should suggest ambition.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a separate bowl, whisk eggs, milk, melted butter (or oil), and vanilla.
              Stir with confidence.
            </li>
            <li>
              Combine wet and dry ingredients until just mixed. Lumps are not mistakes—
              they are texture decisions.
            </li>
            <li>Fold in your chosen mix-ins gently. This is not the time for aggression.</li>
            <li>
              Pour batter into the waffle iron, close the lid, and trust the process.
              Resist opening it early. Chaos still requires patience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cook until deeply golden and crisp. Remove carefully and repeat until the
              experiment concludes.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Serving Notes</h3>
          <p>
            Serve with maple syrup, powdered sugar, fresh fruit, or something bold like
            honey butter or peanut butter drizzle. The Chaos Waffle supports creative
            topping decisions.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Final observation:</strong> Chaos does not mean failure. When built on
            a solid foundation, experimentation can be delicious. The waffle may surprise
            you—but it will not betray you.
