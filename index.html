      <h2>What is The Vigilant Waffle</h2>

      <p>
        The Vigilant Waffle is a highly serious* internet project dedicated to curiosity, experimentation, and
        maintaining a watchful eye over things that may or may not matter. It exists at the intersection of
        creativity, technology, and late-night “what if I tried this?” decisions that seemed reasonable at the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite its breakfast-themed name, The Vigilant Waffle is less about syrup and more about staying alert,
        learning in public, and occasionally breaking things just to understand how they worked in the first place.
        Some experiments succeed, some fail gloriously, and a few become cautionary tales for future waffles.
      </p>

      <p>
        This space serves as a living archive for small projects, half-baked concepts, and fully toasted experiments—
        all documented with curiosity, humor, and just enough vigilance to pretend this was the plan all along.
        No waffles were harmed in the making of this site. Probably.
      </p>

      <p class="purpose">
        This site exists to document experiments, lessons learned, and the occasional mandatory requirement,
        approached with equal parts compliance, creativity, and controlled chaos.
      </p>

            This shenanigan exists in a state of deliberate readiness. At present, the Vigilant Waffle does not
            know what future assignments will demand, what new requirements will emerge, or which unexpected
            constraints will arrive disguised as “simple updates.” This uncertainty has been acknowledged and
            accepted.
          </p>

          <p>
            While the exact shape of forthcoming work remains unknown, the waffle stands prepared to respond.
            Tables will be created. Semantics will be honored. Styling will be adjusted. Mandatory elements will
            be integrated—sometimes willingly, sometimes creatively—but always successfully. No requirement is
            beyond adaptation.
          </p>

          <p>
            This entry remains open to reflect a posture of readiness rather than progress. The site will evolve
            as instructions arrive, and each new demand will be met with equal parts compliance, curiosity, and
            controlled chaos.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I’m learning:</strong> You don’t need to know every requirement in advance to be
            prepared. A solid foundation, flexible structure, and a willingness to adapt make it possible to
            handle whatever arrives—mandatory or otherwise.

        <div class="shenanigan-content">
          <p>
            This shenanigan was born the moment the syllabus uttered the ancient words: <em>“Add a table.”</em>  
            The Vigilant Waffle, already rich with expandable shenanigans and carefully curated chaos, was suddenly
            required to present its work in rows. And columns. And clearly labeled academic order.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rather than cramming existing shenanigans into a spreadsheet-shaped box and pretending that was normal,
            a new section was forged specifically to appease the rubric gods. The section was named
            <strong>Waffle Works</strong>, because calling it “Projects” felt like a personal attack on the brand.
            A fully compliant table followed, complete with a <strong>&lt;caption&gt;</strong>,
            <strong>&lt;thead&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;tbody&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;tfoot&gt;</strong>,
            and even a <strong>&lt;colgroup&gt;</strong>—because if you’re going to do it, you might as well do it loudly.
          </p>

          <p>
            The required “sample entries” were embraced, not resisted. Two intentionally unserious rows were created
            under the proud titles of <em>Mandatory Sample Line #1</em> and <em>#2</em>, whose only purpose in life
            is to prove that the table functions correctly. Their visual accompaniment is an actual image of the
            Vigilant Waffle holding a sign that reads <strong>PLACEHOLDER</strong>, because subtlety was never part
            of the plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            The end result satisfies every technical requirement while making it abundantly clear that the waffle
            knows exactly what it’s doing—and is choosing chaos anyway.
          </p>

          <p>
            Can we also all agree that the <strong>zoom in on hover</strong> screams MySpace era and should be removed...
            one day maybe it will be because I sure don't like it.

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Academic requirements and creative voice do not have to be enemies.
            With semantic HTML, a little planning, and a willingness to commit to the bit, you can satisfy a rubric
            <em>and</em> make it funny. Also: <strong>&lt;colgroup&gt;</strong> exists, and now I know why.

        <div class="shenanigan-content">
          <p>
            This shenanigan began when it became painfully obvious that the Shenanigans section was growing faster
            than its ability to remain inviting. Scrolling felt endless, scanning felt exhausting, and the waffle
            realized that enthusiasm alone was no longer enough to maintain order.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rather than reaching immediately for JavaScript, the experiment paused to ask a more dangerous question:
            <em>“What can native HTML already do?”</em> The answer arrived in the form of semantic elements designed
            specifically for this kind of interaction. By restructuring each shenanigan into an expandable entry,
            recent work stayed visible while older experiments politely collapsed until summoned.
          </p>

          <p>
            The result was a section that scaled naturally, remained readable, and required zero additional scripts.
            The page became lighter, clearer, and easier to navigate—proving that sometimes the best solution is
            already built into the language.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Native HTML elements can provide elegant interaction patterns, and
            careful structure often eliminates the need for extra code. Sometimes the most powerful tool is simply
            knowing what the platform already offers.

        <div class="shenanigan-content">
          <p>
            This shenanigan emerged once it became clear that the growing list of experiments was becoming… dense.
            What started as a simple chronological log slowly transformed into a wall of text that demanded far more
            commitment than casual curiosity could reasonably provide. The waffle sensed impending disorder.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead of adding new features, the focus shifted to presentation. Entries were grouped into consistent
            structures with clear titles, visible status indicators, and explicit lessons learned. Expandable cards
            were introduced to let recent work remain visible while older shenanigans politely stepped aside unless
            summoned. The result was not fewer shenanigans—just better-behaved ones.
          </p>

          <p>
            The reorganization made the section easier to scan, easier to maintain, and far less intimidating to
            anyone arriving without a full afternoon to spare. It also reinforced the idea that how information is
            presented is part of the experiment, not an afterthought.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Structure matters. Thoughtful organization improves readability,
            scalability, and comprehension—and sometimes the most impactful improvement is simply arranging things
            so they make sense.

            This shenanigan began with an uncomfortable realization: the Vigilant Waffle was watching over images
            that were far larger than they needed to be. While the site technically worked, it loaded with all the
            urgency of a breakfast buffet at peak hours. Something had to change.
          </p>

          <p>
            The experiment focused on resizing images to their actual display dimensions, compressing them to reduce
            file size, and embracing modern formats that browsers actually like. The visual design remained intact,
            but the page became noticeably lighter and faster—proving that performance improvements don’t have to
            come at the cost of aesthetics.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once the excess was trimmed away, the site felt more responsive, more intentional, and far less
            judgmental when viewed on slower connections. The waffle approved the results and quietly removed the
            extra calories.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Image performance has a direct impact on perceived speed. Small,
            thoughtful optimizations add up quickly, and restraint is sometimes the most effective performance tool.

            This shenanigan began with the dangerous assumption that a layout which looked excellent on a large
            desktop monitor would naturally behave itself on smaller screens. The site was clean. The navigation
            was aligned. Confidence was once again misplaced.
          </p>

          <p>
            Opening the page on a phone immediately revealed the truth. Buttons felt cramped. Spacing collapsed.
            Navigation links that once felt orderly now demanded far too much attention. The waffle was forced
            to confront the fact that desktop success means very little without deliberate mobile testing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Media queries were introduced, spacing was adjusted, and navigation was refined into a more touch-friendly
            layout. What emerged was not just a responsive page, but a healthier respect for how users actually
            interact with websites across devices.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Responsive design must be tested early and often. A layout that
            succeeds on desktop can still fail spectacularly on mobile if responsiveness is treated as an
            afterthought.

            This shenanigan began with the bold and questionable idea that The Vigilant Waffle should briefly attempt
            to be a “serious” website. Plans included neutral language, restrained formatting, and the removal of
            unnecessary waffle references in favor of something called “professional tone.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Initial progress was promising for approximately seven minutes. Shortly thereafter, the waffle grew
            uncomfortable, jokes began leaking back into the content, and the phrase “internet shenanigans” reappeared
            uninvited. The experiment was formally abandoned once it became clear that seriousness was incompatible
            with both the brand and the mission.

          <p>
            This shenanigan marks the exact moment the site crossed from “technically functional” into
            “visually intentional.” Until this point, the Vigilant Waffle relied entirely on raw HTML,
            default browser styles, and a generous number of <strong>&lt;hr&gt;</strong> tags to impose order
            on an increasingly chaotic page.
          </p>

          <p>
            The introduction of CSS was immediate and dramatic. Fonts aligned. Spacing made sense.
            Colors appeared. The once-essential horizontal rules suddenly looked loud, clunky, and deeply
            unnecessary. One by one, the <strong>&lt;hr&gt;</strong> tags were removed, not out of spite,
            but out of respect for a better way forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            What began as a simple stylesheet quickly reshaped how content was structured, grouped, and
            prioritized. The waffle realized that presentation wasn’t something added at the end—it was
            inseparable from the markup itself.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Once CSS enters the picture, structure and presentation evolve
            together. Good styling doesn’t decorate HTML—it changes how you think about building it.

            This shenanigan began with the wildly optimistic assumption that adding a single image to a static website
            would be a calm, uneventful task. The image existed. The HTML tag was correct. Confidence was high.
            Unfortunately, the waffle had underestimated the internet.
          </p>

          <p>
            What followed was a crash course in folder structure discipline, the unforgiving nature of case-sensitive
            file paths, the difference between renaming a file and actually converting its format, and the mysterious
            delay between uploading an image and GitHub Pages deciding it deserved to exist. Multiple “this should
            work” moments were declared, immediately followed by disappointment.

          <p>
            After verifying directories, correcting capitalization, clearing caches, and waiting patiently for the
            deployment gods to finish their coffee, the image finally appeared. The waffle celebrated briefly and then
            wrote everything down so it would never have to learn this lesson again.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> On the web, small details like file names, paths, formats, and caching

            The battle involved verifying repository structure, confirming which branch was actually being published,
            relocating the <strong>index.html</strong> file multiple times “just to be sure,” and waiting patiently for
            GitHub Pages to decide whether or not it believed in the concept of time. Several false victories were
