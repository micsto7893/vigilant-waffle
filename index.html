            <h2>About The Vigilant Waffle</h2>
            <p>
                The Vigilant Waffle is a highly serious* internet project dedicated to curiosity, experimentation, and keeping a watchful eye on things that may or may not matter.
                It exists at the crossroads of creativity, technology, and late-night “what if I tried this?” ideas.
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite its breakfast-themed name, The Vigilant Waffle is less about syrup and more about staying alert, learning in public, and occasionally breaking things just to
                see how they work. Some ideas succeed, some fail gloriously, and all of them are part of the process.
            </p>

            <p>
                This space is a home for small projects, half-baked concepts, and fully toasted experiments—built with curiosity, humor, and just enough vigilance to keep things 
                interesting. No waffles were harmed in the making of this site. Probably.

                A highly advanced static website built with HTML, curiosity, and just enough Googling to be dangerous. 
                Deployed to the internet using GitHub Pages after several intense battles with a 404 error.
