      <h2>What is The Vigilant Waffle</h2>

      <p>
        The Vigilant Waffle is a highly serious* internet project dedicated to curiosity, experimentation, and keeping a watchful
        eye on things that may or may not matter. It exists at the crossroads of creativity, technology, and late-night “what if I tried this?” ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite its breakfast-themed name, The Vigilant Waffle is less about syrup and more about staying alert, learning in public,
        and occasionally breaking things just to see how they work. Some ideas succeed, some fail gloriously, and all of them are
        part of the process.
      </p>

      <p>
        This space is a home for small projects, half-baked concepts, and fully toasted experiments—built with curiosity, humor,
        and just enough vigilance to keep things interesting. No waffles were harmed in the making of this site. Probably.
      </p>

      <p class="purpose">
        This site exists to document small experiments, lessons learned, and the occasional gloriously broken idea along the way.
      </p>

      <h2>Shenanigans</h2>

      <p class="shenanigans-intro">
        The most recent shenanigan appears first. Older entries can be expanded if curiosity strikes.
      </p>

        <summary class="shenanigan-summary">
          <span class="shenanigan-title">The Mandatory Table Tribute (Waffle Works Edition)</span>

        </summary>

        <div class="shenanigan-content">
          <p>
            This shenanigan was born the moment the syllabus uttered the ancient words: <em>“Add a table.”</em>  
            The Vigilant Waffle, already rich with expandable shenanigans and carefully curated chaos, was suddenly
            required to present its work in rows. And columns. And clearly labeled academic order.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rather than cramming existing shenanigans into a spreadsheet-shaped box and pretending that was normal,
            a new section was forged specifically to appease the rubric gods. The section was named
            <strong>Waffle Works</strong>, because calling it “Projects” felt like a personal attack on the brand.
            A fully compliant table followed, complete with a <strong>&lt;caption&gt;</strong>,
            <strong>&lt;thead&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;tbody&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;tfoot&gt;</strong>,
            and even a <strong>&lt;colgroup&gt;</strong>—because if you’re going to do it, you might as well do it loudly.
          </p>

          <p>
            The required “sample entries” were embraced, not resisted. Two intentionally unserious rows were created
            under the proud titles of <em>Mandatory Sample Line #1</em> and <em>#2</em>, whose only purpose in life
            is to prove that the table functions correctly. Their visual accompaniment is an actual image of the
            Vigilant Waffle holding a sign that reads <strong>PLACEHOLDER</strong>, because subtlety was never part
            of the plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            The end result satisfies every technical requirement while making it abundantly clear that the waffle
            knows exactly what it’s doing—and is choosing chaos anyway.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Academic requirements and creative voice do not have to be enemies.
            With semantic HTML, a little planning, and a willingness to commit to the bit, you can satisfy a rubric
            <em>and</em> make it funny. Also: <strong>&lt;colgroup&gt;</strong> exists, and now I know why.

            This shenanigan focused on improving how experiments are presented rather than adding new technical functionality. As the list of shenanigans
            grew, the section began to feel heavier and less inviting to scan. Instead of introducing JavaScript, the experiment explored what could be accomplished
            using native HTML and CSS alone, specifically leveraging semantic elements to create expandable, readable entries.

          <p class="lesson">

            This shenanigan began with the bold and questionable idea that The Vigilant Waffle should briefly attempt
            to be a “serious” website. Plans included neutral language, restrained formatting, and the removal of
            unnecessary waffle references in favor of something called “professional tone.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Initial progress was promising for approximately seven minutes. Shortly thereafter, the waffle grew
            uncomfortable, jokes began leaking back into the content, and the phrase “internet shenanigans” reappeared
            uninvited. The experiment was formally abandoned once it became clear that seriousness was incompatible
            with both the brand and the mission.

            No data was lost, but dignity was briefly misplaced.

            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Not every idea deserves completion. Knowing when to abandon a concept
            can be just as important as knowing how to build one—especially when waffles are involved.
