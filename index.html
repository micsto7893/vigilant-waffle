      <h2>What is The Vigilant Waffle</h2>

      <p>
        The Vigilant Waffle is a highly serious* internet project dedicated to curiosity, experimentation, and keeping a watchful
        eye on things that may or may not matter. It exists at the crossroads of creativity, technology, and late-night “what if I tried this?” ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite its breakfast-themed name, The Vigilant Waffle is less about syrup and more about staying alert, learning in public,
        and occasionally breaking things just to see how they work. Some ideas succeed, some fail gloriously, and all of them are
        part of the process.
      </p>

      <p>
        This space is a home for small projects, half-baked concepts, and fully toasted experiments—built with curiosity, humor,
        and just enough vigilance to keep things interesting. No waffles were harmed in the making of this site. Probably.
      </p>

      <p class="purpose">
        This site exists to document small experiments, lessons learned, and the occasional gloriously broken idea along the way.
      </p>

        The most recent shenanigan appears first. Older entries can be expanded if curiosity strikes.

        <div class="shenanigan-content">
          <p>
            Today’s shenanigan began with a classic classroom plot twist: “Add a table.” The site already had personality and a growing archive
            of expandable shenanigans, but the rubric demanded structured, tabular proof of life—complete with a <strong>&lt;caption&gt;</strong>,
            <strong>&lt;thead&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;tbody&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;tfoot&gt;</strong>, and even a <strong>&lt;colgroup&gt;</strong>
            to style specific columns. Instead of forcing real shenanigans into the table and muddying the timeline, the Waffle created a dedicated
            section for the requirement and gave it a properly whimsical name: <strong>Waffle Works</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            To keep things fun, the “sample projects” became intentionally comedic “mandatory sample” entries, and the boring gray placeholder boxes
            were replaced with an actual Vigilant Waffle image holding a sign that says <strong>PLACEHOLDER</strong>. The result: the rubric is satisfied,
            the site stays on-brand, and the waffle remains both compliant and mildly sarcastic.
          
          </p>
          
          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> You can meet strict HTML requirements without sacrificing theme—use semantic structure for the grade,
            and creative presentation for the personality (also: <strong>&lt;colgroup&gt;</strong> is weirdly powerful).

            This shenanigan focused on improving how experiments are presented rather than adding new technical functionality. As the list of shenanigans
            grew, the section began to feel heavier and less inviting to scan. Instead of introducing JavaScript, the experiment explored what could be accomplished
            using native HTML and CSS alone, specifically leveraging semantic elements to create expandable, readable entries.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Native HTML elements can provide elegant interaction patterns, and careful structure often eliminates the need for extra code.

            This shenanigan focused on restructuring how experiments are presented rather than introducing a new technical feature. What began as a growing list
