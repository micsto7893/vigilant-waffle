            <h2>What is The Vigilant Waffle</h2>
            <p>
              The Vigilant Waffle is a highly serious* internet project dedicated to curiosity, experimentation, and keeping a watchful 
              eye on things that may or may not matter. It exists at the crossroads of creativity, technology, and late-night “what if I tried this?” ideas.
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite its breakfast-themed name, The Vigilant Waffle is less about syrup and more about staying alert, learning in public, 
              and occasionally breaking things just to see how they work. Some ideas succeed, some fail gloriously, and all of them are 
              part of the process.
            </p>

            <p>
              This space is a home for small projects, half-baked concepts, and fully toasted experiments—built with curiosity, humor, 
              and just enough vigilance to keep things interesting. No waffles were harmed in the making of this site. Probably.
            </p>
          
          <p class="purpose">
            This site exists to document small experiments, lessons learned, and the occasional gloriously broken idea along the way.
          </p>

            <p><em>*Results may vary.</em></p>

            <div class="shenanigan-card">
              <p> This shenanigan focused on restructuring how experiments are presented rather than introducing a new technical feature. What began as a growing 
                list of chronological entries evolved into a more intentional format designed for readability and long-term growth. By grouping each experiment 
                into a consistent “card” structure with clear titles, status indicators, and explicit lessons learned, the Shenanigans section became easier to 
                scan and more inviting to explore. The process reinforced the idea that presentation is part of the experiment itself. Organizing content 
                thoughtfully not only improves usability for readers but also clarifies thinking for the person doing the work. The Vigilant Waffle didn’t just 
                document shenanigans this time—it reorganized them.
              </p>
              
              <p class="lesson">
               💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> How information is structured matters as much as the information itself, and a little organization can 
               dramatically improve clarity and usefulness.

            <h3>The Great Image Diet</h3>

            <span class="status complete">Complete</span>
            
            <p>
            This shenanigan began with a simple realization: the Vigilant Waffle was watching over images that were far larger than they needed to be. 
            While the page worked, it took longer than expected to load, especially on slower connections—an early warning sign that performance, not 
            just appearance, matters on the web. The experiment focused on resizing images to their actual display dimensions, compressing them to reduce 
            file size, and introducing modern browser features like lazy loading. By switching to more efficient formats and telling the browser when 
            images actually needed to load, the site became faster and more responsive without changing its visual design. The result was a noticeably 
            snappier page and an important lesson: optimization isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about intentional restraint. The waffle remains vigilant, 
            but now travels much lighter.
            </p>

             <p class="lesson">
               💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Image performance has a direct impact on perceived speed, and small optimizations add up quickly.
             </p>

            <h3>Responsive Reality Check</h3>

            <span class="status complete">Complete</span>
            
            <p>
            After adding CSS and celebrating a more polished layout, this experiment revealed that a design that looks great on desktop doesn’t automatically 
            translate well to mobile screens. Navigation buttons felt clunky, spacing became inconsistent, and the page demanded a second pass with responsiveness 
            in mind. By introducing media queries and refining the navigation into a cleaner, pill-style layout, the site became more usable across devices—
            reinforcing that modern web design requires testing beyond a single screen size.
            </p>

             <p class="lesson">
               💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Responsive design has to be tested early and often—desktop success doesn’t guarantee mobile usability.

            <h3>The CSS Awakening (and the Death of &lt;hr&gt;)</h3>

            <span class="status complete">Complete</span>
            
            <p>
            This experiment marked the moment styling was officially allowed and the site transitioned from pure HTML into a more polished layout using CSS. 
            Initial attempts ran into issues linking the stylesheet correctly, highlighting the importance of file paths and proper <strong>&lt;link&gt;</strong> 
            placement in the HTML head. Once connected, the CSS immediately transformed the page layout, making previously useful <strong>&lt;hr&gt;</strong> separators
            feel visually cluttered and unnecessary. Removing them reinforced how structure and presentation evolve together and demonstrated how good styling can 
            simplify, rather than complicate, the underlying HTML.
            </p>

             <p class="lesson">
               💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Once CSS enters the picture, structure and presentation evolve together—what was once necessary markup can quickly 
               become unnecessary noise.

            <h3>Image Integration Experiment</h3>

            <span class="status complete">Complete</span>
            
            <p>
            This experiment involved adding an image to a static HTML page hosted on GitHub Pages and turned out to be far more adventurous 
            than expected. Along the way, issues like folder structure confusion, case-sensitive file paths, GitHub’s ever-changing 
            interface, caching delays, and the difference between renaming a file versus properly converting an image format all made 
            appearances. After a series of troubleshooting steps and several “this should work” moments, the image finally displayed 
            correctly—proving that even simple tasks can offer valuable lessons when working with web hosting and version control.
            </p>

             <p class="lesson">
               💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> On the web, small details matter—file paths, naming, formats, and caching can all derail simple 
               tasks, and patience is often as important as technical skill.

            <h3>The Great 404 Battle</h3>

            <span class="status complete">Complete</span>
            
            <p>
            This experiment focused on deploying a simple HTML site using GitHub Pages and quickly turned into a lesson in patience and 
            attention to detail. Initial attempts were met with persistent 404 errors caused by publishing settings, branch and folder 
            selection, and the placement of the <strong>index.html</strong> file. After verifying repository structure, adjusting Pages 
            configuration, and waiting through deployment delays, the site finally went live—demonstrating how small configuration details 
            can have outsized effects when working with static site hosting.
            </p>

             <p class="lesson">
               💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> With static hosting, configuration details matter as much as code—small setup choices can 
               be the difference between a working site and a stubborn 404.
