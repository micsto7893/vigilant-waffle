            <h2>What is The Vigilant Waffle</h2>
            <p>
              The Vigilant Waffle is a highly serious* internet project dedicated to curiosity, experimentation, and keeping a watchful 
              eye on things that may or may not matter.
              It exists at the crossroads of creativity, technology, and late-night “what if I tried this?” ideas.
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite its breakfast-themed name, The Vigilant Waffle is less about syrup and more about staying alert, learning in public, 
              and occasionally breaking things just to see how they work. Some ideas succeed, some fail gloriously, and all of them are 
              part of the process.
            </p>

            <p>
              This space is a home for small projects, half-baked concepts, and fully toasted experiments—built with curiosity, humor, 
              and just enough vigilance to keep things interesting. No waffles were harmed in the making of this site. Probably.

          <h3>Image Integration Experiment</h3>
          <p><strong>Status:</strong> Complete</p>
          <p>
            This experiment involved adding an image to a static HTML page hosted on GitHub Pages and turned out to be far more adventurous 
            than expected. Along the way, issues like folder structure confusion, case-sensitive file paths, GitHub’s ever-changing 
            interface, caching delays, and the difference between renaming a file versus properly converting an image format all made 
            appearances. After a series of troubleshooting steps and several “this should work” moments, the image finally displayed 
            correctly—proving that even simple tasks can offer valuable lessons when working with web hosting and version control.

          <h3>The Great 404 Battle</h3>
          <p><strong>Status:</strong> Complete</p>
          <p>
            This experiment focused on deploying a simple HTML site using GitHub Pages and quickly turned into a lesson in patience and 
            attention to detail. Initial attempts were met with persistent 404 errors caused by publishing settings, branch and folder 
            selection, and the placement of the <strong>index.html</strong> file. After verifying repository structure, adjusting Pages 
            configuration, and waiting through deployment delays, the site finally went live—demonstrating how small configuration details 
            can have outsized effects when working with static site hosting.
