      <h2>What is The Vigilant Waffle</h2>

      <p>
        The Vigilant Waffle is a highly serious* internet project dedicated to curiosity, experimentation, and
        maintaining a watchful eye over things that may or may not matter. It exists at the intersection of
        creativity, technology, and late-night “what if I tried this?” decisions that seemed reasonable at the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite its breakfast-themed name, The Vigilant Waffle is less about syrup and more about staying alert,
        learning in public, and occasionally breaking things just to understand how they worked in the first place.
        Some experiments succeed, some fail gloriously, and a few become cautionary tales for future waffles.
      </p>

      <p>
        This space serves as a living archive for small projects, half-baked concepts, and fully toasted experiments—
        all documented with curiosity, humor, and just enough vigilance to pretend this was the plan all along.
        No waffles were harmed in the making of this site. Probably.
      </p>

      <p class="purpose">
        This site exists to document experiments, lessons learned, and the occasional mandatory requirement,
        approached with equal parts compliance, creativity, and controlled chaos.
      </p>

  </summary>

  <div class="shenanigan-content">
    <p>
      This shenanigan began when the Vigilant Waffle realized a website cannot live on experiments alone.
      At some point, it must also provide nourishment. Or at least the illusion of nourishment.
    </p>

    <p>
      A new off-site archive was established: <strong>Vigilant Waffle’s Secret Recipes</strong> — a field manual of
      waffle-making methods recorded for academic compliance and breakfast preparedness.
      It looks like a blog page. It behaves like a blog page. But spiritually, it is a classified cookbook.
    </p>

    <p>
      The operation required:
      semantic structure, multiple “posts” (recipes wearing blog disguises), navigation that doesn’t panic on mobile,
      and a contact section that politely pretends it isn’t a trap.
      All requirements were satisfied. The waffle remains vigilant.
    </p>

    <p>
      For safety reasons, the recipes are considered “declassified,” meaning you are allowed to read them,
      attempt them, and potentially become too powerful before noon.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Filed under:</strong> breakfast, documentation, controlled chaos, and extremely serious culinary intelligence.
    </p>

    <p class="lesson">
      💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> The best projects don’t just meet requirements — they commit to a theme.
      If you’re going to build a “blog,” it can also be a waffle dossier. Structure + personality = unstoppable.

    <span class="shenanigan-title">JavaScript, But Make It Roll</span>
    <span class="status complete">Complete</span>
  </summary>

  <div class="shenanigan-content">
    <p>
      This shenanigan was triggered by the introduction of JavaScript into an otherwise calm and responsible
      contact page. The original requirement involved intercepting a form submission, validating user input,
      and displaying a confirmation message on the page. All of this functionality was reviewed, understood,
      and preserved.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, a critical realization emerged: the Vigilant Waffle does not wish to receive emails from this site.
      The form exists to satisfy structure and interaction requirements—not to summon actual correspondence.
      Sending messages into the void felt more honest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than removing the JavaScript entirely, the original logic was intentionally commented out and
      replaced with a simpler, more transparent behavior. Upon submission, the form politely prevents all default
      actions and redirects the user to an unexpected but culturally significant musical experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      No data is collected. No inbox is harmed. The waffle remains vigilant.
    </p>

    <p class="lesson">
      💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> JavaScript does not have to be complex to be effective. Understanding
      what code does—and choosing when <em>not</em> to use it—is just as important as writing it. Also, sometimes
      the most honest response to a form submission is a Rick Roll.
    </p>

      <details class="shenanigan-card">
  <summary class="shenanigan-summary">
    <span class="shenanigan-title">The Waffle’s Office (Unexpected Pivot)</span>
    <span class="status complete">Complete</span>
  </summary>

  <div class="shenanigan-content">
    <p>
      This shenanigan started as a totally normal follow-up to the abandoned backdrop experiment. The plan was simple:
      keep the contact page clean, readable, and responsibly un-mystical. No visual sabotage. No arcane wallpaper.
      Just a form.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then the Vigilant Waffle had a thought: <em>“What if the summoning chamber isn’t a chamber at all?”</em>
      What if it’s an office? A calm place. A place with boundaries. A place where you sit down and talk about why you
      tried to summon a waffle in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
      And just like that, the page pivoted from ritual vibes to therapist vibes. The Summoning Chamber quietly became
      <strong>The Waffle’s Office</strong>—complete with a therapist waffle, an empty couch, and a tone shift so gentle
      it could be billed by the hour.
    </p>

    <p>
      The best part was that nothing broke. No new gimmicks were needed. The content simply matured into something
      funnier and more usable at the same time. The waffle didn’t become less chaotic… it became more intentional.
    </p>

    <p class="lesson">
      💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Sometimes the best design choice is a tone shift, not a feature. If the vibe
      is fighting usability, you don’t have to force it—just reframe the experience into something clearer, calmer,
      and still on-brand.

        <div class="shenanigan-content">
           <p>
             This shenanigan began with a simple, dangerous thought: <em>“What if the contact page felt like a place instead of a form?”</em>
             The goal was to transform the act of reaching out into a ritual—an immersive summoning chamber layered with arcane visuals,
             mysterious energy, and just enough drama to make submitting a message feel important.
           </p>

          <p>
            For a brief moment, it worked. The page looked mystical. It looked intentional. It looked like something significant was about to
            happen.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unfortunately, it also looked like it was actively hiding the form.
          </p>

          <p>
            Attempts were made to tame the chaos. Overlays were adjusted. Opacity values were nudged. Contrast and brightness were debated.
            The background, however, remained stubborn—competing with labels, obscuring inputs, and generally refusing to stay in its lane.The summoning chamber grew increasingly uncooperative.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the end, clarity won. The background was dismantled, the chamber quietly decommissioned, and the page returned to a calmer,
            more readable state. The waffle observed the chaos, documented the outcome, and moved on without regret.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Atmosphere can enhance an experience, but usability always gets the final say—especially when
            users are just trying to send a message.

  </summary>

  <div class="shenanigan-content">
    <p>
      This shenanigan focused on creating a dedicated contact page rather than relying on a simple mail link.
      What began as a straightforward requirement quickly evolved into an opportunity to extend the Vigilant
      Waffle’s personality beyond the homepage and into a space that users would actively interact with.
    </p>

    <p>
      The contact page was designed as a “Summoning Chamber,” reframing a standard form as a ritual. Required
      metadata, accessibility-friendly labels, and form validation were implemented alongside intentionally
      playful language to ensure the page met technical requirements without sacrificing tone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Navigation was updated to support moving between the main site and the chamber, and layout decisions
      emphasized clarity and responsiveness across screen sizes. While the form itself remained simple, the
      surrounding context transformed the experience from mundane to deliberate.
    </p>

    <p>
      By separating the act of summoning from the homepage and giving it its own space, the site gained a
      clearer structure—and the waffle gained a proper place to receive messages.
    </p>

    <p class="lesson">
      💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Even ordinary features like contact forms benefit from thoughtful
      framing—personality and usability can coexist without compromising either.

        <div class="shenanigan-content">
          <p>
            This shenanigan was born the moment the syllabus uttered the ancient words: <em>“Add a table.”</em>  
            The Vigilant Waffle, already rich with expandable shenanigans and carefully curated chaos, was suddenly
            required to present its work in rows. And columns. And clearly labeled academic order.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rather than cramming existing shenanigans into a spreadsheet-shaped box and pretending that was normal,
            a new section was forged specifically to appease the rubric gods. The section was named
            <strong>Waffle Works</strong>, because calling it “Projects” felt like a personal attack on the brand.
            A fully compliant table followed, complete with a <strong>&lt;caption&gt;</strong>,
            <strong>&lt;thead&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;tbody&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;tfoot&gt;</strong>,
            and even a <strong>&lt;colgroup&gt;</strong>—because if you’re going to do it, you might as well do it loudly.
          </p>

          <p>
            The required “sample entries” were embraced, not resisted. Two intentionally unserious rows were created
            under the proud titles of <em>Mandatory Sample Line #1</em> and <em>#2</em>, whose only purpose in life
            is to prove that the table functions correctly. Their visual accompaniment is an actual image of the
            Vigilant Waffle holding a sign that reads <strong>PLACEHOLDER</strong>, because subtlety was never part
            of the plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            The end result satisfies every technical requirement while making it abundantly clear that the waffle
            knows exactly what it’s doing—and is choosing chaos anyway.
          </p>

          <p>
            Can we also all agree that the <strong>zoom in on hover</strong> screams MySpace era and should be removed...

            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Academic requirements and creative voice do not have to be enemies.
            With semantic HTML, a little planning, and a willingness to commit to the bit, you can satisfy a rubric
            <em>and</em> make it funny. Also: <strong>&lt;colgroup&gt;</strong> exists, and now I know why.

        <div class="shenanigan-content">
          <p>
            This shenanigan began when it became painfully obvious that the Shenanigans section was growing faster
            than its ability to remain inviting. Scrolling felt endless, scanning felt exhausting, and the waffle
            realized that enthusiasm alone was no longer enough to maintain order.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rather than reaching immediately for JavaScript, the experiment paused to ask a more dangerous question:
            <em>“What can native HTML already do?”</em> The answer arrived in the form of semantic elements designed
            specifically for this kind of interaction. By restructuring each shenanigan into an expandable entry,
            recent work stayed visible while older experiments politely collapsed until summoned.
          </p>

          <p>
            The result was a section that scaled naturally, remained readable, and required zero additional scripts.
            The page became lighter, clearer, and easier to navigate—proving that sometimes the best solution is
            already built into the language.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Native HTML elements can provide elegant interaction patterns, and
            careful structure often eliminates the need for extra code. Sometimes the most powerful tool is simply
            knowing what the platform already offers.

            This shenanigan emerged once it became clear that the growing list of experiments was becoming… dense.
            What started as a simple chronological log slowly transformed into a wall of text that demanded far more
            commitment than casual curiosity could reasonably provide. The waffle sensed impending disorder.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead of adding new features, the focus shifted to presentation. Entries were grouped into consistent
            structures with clear titles, visible status indicators, and explicit lessons learned. Expandable cards
            were introduced to let recent work remain visible while older shenanigans politely stepped aside unless
            summoned. The result was not fewer shenanigans—just better-behaved ones.
          </p>

          <p>
            The reorganization made the section easier to scan, easier to maintain, and far less intimidating to
            anyone arriving without a full afternoon to spare. It also reinforced the idea that how information is
            presented is part of the experiment, not an afterthought.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Structure matters. Thoughtful organization improves readability,

            This shenanigan began with an uncomfortable realization: the Vigilant Waffle was watching over images
            that were far larger than they needed to be. While the site technically worked, it loaded with all the
            urgency of a breakfast buffet at peak hours. Something had to change.
          </p>

          <p>
            The experiment focused on resizing images to their actual display dimensions, compressing them to reduce
            file size, and embracing modern formats that browsers actually like. The visual design remained intact,
            but the page became noticeably lighter and faster—proving that performance improvements don’t have to
            come at the cost of aesthetics.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once the excess was trimmed away, the site felt more responsive, more intentional, and far less
            judgmental when viewed on slower connections. The waffle approved the results and quietly removed the
            extra calories.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Image performance has a direct impact on perceived speed. Small,

            This shenanigan began with the dangerous assumption that a layout which looked excellent on a large
            desktop monitor would naturally behave itself on smaller screens. The site was clean. The navigation
            was aligned. Confidence was once again misplaced.
          </p>

          <p>
            Opening the page on a phone immediately revealed the truth. Buttons felt cramped. Spacing collapsed.
            Navigation links that once felt orderly now demanded far too much attention. The waffle was forced
            to confront the fact that desktop success means very little without deliberate mobile testing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Media queries were introduced, spacing was adjusted, and navigation was refined into a more touch-friendly
            layout. What emerged was not just a responsive page, but a healthier respect for how users actually
            interact with websites across devices.

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Responsive design must be tested early and often. A layout that

            This shenanigan began with the bold and questionable idea that The Vigilant Waffle should briefly attempt
            to be a “serious” website. Plans included neutral language, restrained formatting, and the removal of
            unnecessary waffle references in favor of something called “professional tone.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Initial progress was promising for approximately seven minutes. Shortly thereafter, the waffle grew
            uncomfortable, jokes began leaking back into the content, and the phrase “internet shenanigans” reappeared
            uninvited. The experiment was formally abandoned once it became clear that seriousness was incompatible
            with both the brand and the mission.

            No data was lost, but dignity was briefly misplaced.

            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Not every idea deserves completion. Knowing when to abandon a concept
            can be just as important as knowing how to build one—especially when waffles are involved.

            This shenanigan marks the exact moment the site crossed from “technically functional” into
            “visually intentional.” Until this point, the Vigilant Waffle relied entirely on raw HTML,
            default browser styles, and a generous number of <strong>&lt;hr&gt;</strong> tags to impose order
            on an increasingly chaotic page.
          </p>

          <p>
            The introduction of CSS was immediate and dramatic. Fonts aligned. Spacing made sense.
            Colors appeared. The once-essential horizontal rules suddenly looked loud, clunky, and deeply
            unnecessary. One by one, the <strong>&lt;hr&gt;</strong> tags were removed, not out of spite,
            but out of respect for a better way forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            What began as a simple stylesheet quickly reshaped how content was structured, grouped, and
            prioritized. The waffle realized that presentation wasn’t something added at the end—it was
            inseparable from the markup itself.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> Once CSS enters the picture, structure and presentation evolve
            together. Good styling doesn’t decorate HTML—it changes how you think about building it.

            This shenanigan began with the wildly optimistic assumption that adding a single image to a static website
            would be a calm, uneventful task. The image existed. The HTML tag was correct. Confidence was high.
            Unfortunately, the waffle had underestimated the internet.
          </p>

          <p>
            What followed was a crash course in folder structure discipline, the unforgiving nature of case-sensitive
            file paths, the difference between renaming a file and actually converting its format, and the mysterious
            delay between uploading an image and GitHub Pages deciding it deserved to exist. Multiple “this should
            work” moments were declared, immediately followed by disappointment.
          </p>

          <p>
            After verifying directories, correcting capitalization, clearing caches, and waiting patiently for the
            deployment gods to finish their coffee, the image finally appeared. The waffle celebrated briefly and then
            wrote everything down so it would never have to learn this lesson again.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> On the web, small details like file names, paths, formats, and caching
            behavior can derail even the simplest tasks—and patience is a legitimate technical skill.

            This shenanigan began as a routine attempt to deploy a very simple website to GitHub Pages and immediately
            escalated into a prolonged standoff with an aggressively unhelpful <strong>404 Not Found</strong> message.
            Every file appeared to exist. Every setting looked correct. The waffle remained vigilant.
          </p>

          <p>
            The battle involved verifying repository structure, confirming which branch was actually being published,
            relocating the <strong>index.html</strong> file multiple times “just to be sure,” and waiting patiently for
            GitHub Pages to decide whether or not it believed in the concept of time. Several false victories were
            declared before the site finally rendered something other than disappointment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Victory was achieved not through new code, but through understanding configuration, placement, and the
            delicate art of waiting five more minutes and refreshing the page again.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson">
            💡 <strong>What I learned:</strong> With static hosting, configuration details matter just as much as the
            code itself—and sometimes the real bug is simply publishing the right file in the right place and waiting
            for the internet to catch up.
